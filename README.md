# Advent-of-Code-2023
My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in Python. I have chosen this language in order to enhance my familiarity with it before building larger projects with it.

Puzzle and test inputs are not included as requested in the about section of the site:

> Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.

I highly encourage you to try out the problems for yourself before viewing my or anyone else's solutions.

To get started, place `create_template_files.py` and `template.py` in your chosen root directory and run the former. This will create 25 folders, one for each day, each with template Python and input files, as well as a gitignore file to prevent you from inadvertantly including your puzzle inputs in an online repository.
